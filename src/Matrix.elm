{-| A library for fast immutable rectangular matrices. The elements in a matrix must have the same type. The matrices are implemented on top of Elm's built-in arrays: `type alias Matrix a = Array (Array a)`. While all functions in this library preserve the rectangular property of the matrices, this isn't enforced, so make sure you manipulate the matrices using this API and not Array functions.

Geared towards 2D games.

The API is very unstable and will be changed and revamped many times. I am very happy to discuss and accept any ideas, suggestions, and pull requests on the GitHub page:

{-| Similar to setMany, but behaves differently. You provide a
function that returns indexes, a function that converts objects,
and a list of objects. The index-generating function is applied
to each object to generate indexes. Then the converting function
is applied to each object. Then converted objects are put into
the matrix.

This function is useful if you use records of game objects and you
want to generate a matrix of where these objects are on a map.

{-| Take a binary function, a binary predicate, and 2 matrices. The 2 matrices are assumed equal size, although this is not enforced. Compare same-indexed elements using the binary predicate. Return the indexed list of all cells, for which the predicate returns True. The indexed list of cells is of the format [(Int, Int, (a,b))], where `a` is type of element from first matrix, and `b` is type of element from second matrix.

Consider an example. Suppose you have two matrices:

    square 4 (+)  and  square 4 (*)
    -------            -------
    0 1 2 3            0 0 0 0
    1 2 3 4            0 1 2 3
    2 3 4 5            0 2 4 6
    3 4 5 6            0 3 6 9

We want to return the cells, where second matrix's element is greater than or equal first matrix's element. We want to return these cells in a list, with corresponding indexes.

    compare (<=) (square 4 (+)) (square 4 (*))

returns:

    [(0,0,(0,0)), (2,2,(4,4)), (3,2,(5,6)), (2,3,(5,6)), (3,3,(6,9))]

which corresponds to these cells in both matrices:

    square 4 (+)  and  square 4 (*)
    -------            -------
    0 . . .            0 . . .
    . . . .            . . . .
